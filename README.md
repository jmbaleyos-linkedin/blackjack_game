Blackjack Game in Python

This is a Blackjack game built in Python as part of my journey through the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp.

Itâ€™s my first full project after one week of learning Python, applying fundamental concepts like dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and functions. To make the game more engaging, I also integrated ASCII art for cards.

Features:
* Card dealing system
    - Cards are drawn randomly with proper removal (no duplicates).
* Dynamic scoring system
    - Handles Ace values (1 or 11 depending on hand total).
* Player functionality
    - Choose to hit (get another card) or stand (end turn).
* Dealer AI
    - Dealer automatically draws until reaching 16 or higher.
* Game outcomes
    - Detects win, lose, or draw conditions based on final totals.
* Deck reset
    - Deck reshuffles automatically when running low on cards.
* ASCII card display
    - Cards are printed with ASCII art and shown side by side for readability.

Technologies Used:
* Python 3
* Built-in libraries: random
* Custom ASCII art for card representation
